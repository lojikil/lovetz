# Overview

 These files were the original quick & dirty scripts I wrote for processing some history data whilst on site for a client; we didn't have access to Burp pro or ZAP,
but there was no way I wanted to be scanning IE history files for basic checks like Caching & cookie flags. These are mostly here for historical purposes, but they
also could be useful for quick and dirty checking if you cannot install the full Lovetz.
